Add-on services If you'd like to make a website from your notes, consider getting [[Obsidian Publish]] if the price works for you. If you're interested in an end-to-end encryption syncing solution, we also offer [[Obsidian Sync]]. In addition to end-to-end encryption, Obsidian Sync also comes with version history. Catalyst If you don't need any of the above, you can get a [[Catalyst license]] to support our developer, which also gives you access to [[Insider builds]]. Obsidian Unlimited For those very passionate about the project, there's also the Obsidian Unlimited option, which lets you pay as much as you want to support development and help us stay independent. We recommend going for this option after you've purchased the VIP tier of [[Catalyst license]] so that you can enjoy the benefits. 2. Extending Obsidian CSS themes If you're proficient in CSS, another way is to contribute a theme, so that people who don't know CSS can enjoy your work. If you decide to do so, feel free to share it on the #css-themes channel on Discord, or in the Share & Showcase category on our forum. If you'd like to add your theme to the community theme list, let us know! (Or we might reach out to you first!) Plugins If you're a JavaScript/TypeScript programmer, you can write [[Community plugins]] for Obsidian, now that our plugin API is in alpha. 3.

Your notes are stored in markdown, which is an open format based on plain text files, and so should be readable in the future by any computer that can deal with text files. You can freely edit notes in other software, even while having them open in Obsidian. Per vault data There is, however, some data that is needed by the software that is not stored in markdown. Obsidian creates a directory called .obsidian in the root of any vault you create. This contains your configuration, including custom hotkeys and which plugins are enabled. Any directory starting with a . is invisible on most systems, so you will probably never see it unless you try. If you delete this directory, none of your data will be gone, but you will lose your custom settings. It will be recreated when you open that vault in Obsidian again. If you are using git , it's probably best to ignore the .obsidian/workspace file, because the this file stores your panes and opened files, but we haven't observed any other issues with including it. System directory Obsidian also stores some information in the system directory. This is different per Operating System; on Mac it's /Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian , on Windows %APPDATA%\\Obsidian\\ , and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Obsidian/ or ~/.config/Obsidian/ on Linux. As a result, we recommend against creating a vault in this directory. Aside from that, though, you can create a Vault anywhere your operating system will allow. Obsidian files sync fine with Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, git, and every other syncing service we've tried thus far. Symbolic Links Starting in v0.11.1, Obsidian will recognize symbolic links and junctions. We do not officially recommend using these, but we recognize there are valid use-cases for them. Use them at your own risk. Beware that there are many pitfalls to using symbolic links, and some of them could have serious consequences such as data-loss, file corruption, or could crash Obsidian. Below are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind: Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop. Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets. Disjoint means one folder does not contain another, or vice versa. Obsidian will ignore any symlink to a parent folder of the vault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure you don't end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous. Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or any other kind of sync . If the target of a symlink is itself a directory that's synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts or data loss. Some sync tools (e.g. git) do not follow symlinks, but rather synchronize the path the symlink points to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way. Obsidian's file manager cannot move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on a different drive from your vault, you will not be able to drag files between that folder and other folders using Obsidian's file explorer. (You'll need to use your OS's explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see the move as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also not update any links that depended on the path of that file.) File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) may work, but are not officially supported at this time. Changes performed outside of Obsidian are not watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian will not detect the change, update search indexes, etc. Symlinking things under the .obsidian/ directory in order to share them between vaults has a high chance of corrupting your settings , unless you really really know what you're doing.

If you have Obsidian installed, this link will open the app on your device: Click here Installing Obsidian URI To make sure your operating system redirect obsidian:// URIs to the Obsidian app, there may be additional steps you need to perform. On Windows, running the app once should be sufficient. This will register for the obsidian:// custom protocol handler in the Windows registry. On MacOS, running the app once should be sufficient, however, your app must be installer version 0.8.12 or later. On Linux, there's a much more involved process: First, ensure you create a obsidian.desktop file. See here for details Ensure that your desktop file specifies the Exec field as Exec=executable %u . The %u is used to pass the obsidian:// URIs to the app. If you're using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage --appimage-extract . Then make sure the Exec directive points to the unpacked executable. Using Obsidian URIs Obsidian URIs are typically in this format: obsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value The action is usually the action that you would like to perform. Encoding ==Important== Ensure that your values are properly URI encoded. For example, forward slash characters / must be encoded as %2F and space characters must be encoded as %20 . This is especially important because an improperly encoded \"reserved\" character may break the interpretation of the URI. See here for details Available actions Action open Description: Opens an Obsidian vault, and possibly open a file within that vault. Possible parameters: vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. The vault name is simply the name of the vault folder. The vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault. This ID is unique per folder on your computer. Example: ef6ca3e3b524d22f . There isn't an easy way to find this ID yet, one will be offered at a later date in the vault switcher. Currently it can be found in %appdata%/obsidian/obsidian.json for Windows. For MacOS, replace %appdata% with ~/Library/Application Support/ . For Linux, replace %appdata% with ~/.config/ . file can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file. To resolve the target file, Obsidian uses the same link resolution system as a regular [[wikilink]] within the vault. If the file extension is md , the extension can be omitted. path an absolute file system path to a file. Using this parameter will override both vault and file .

The one in the left pane is a text file, which you can edit using Markdown syntax. The one in the right pane is a Preview of the same text file if you were to export it as HTML, or as a PDF document. Note that some things look different in Preview, and, most obviously, links are not in brackets. To follow a link, click on it in the Preview pane. You can follow links in the Editor pane as well, by holding down Ctrl/Cmd and clicking on the link. If you want to go back to the page you were on before, use the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd-alt-LeftArrow Alternatively, the notes that link to the one you're currently on will be shown in the Backlinks Panel on the right (find more about Backlinks [[Backlinks|here.]]) If you get lost at any time, or just want to explore what else Obsidian can do, Ctrl/Cmd-P brings up the Command Palette. You can type commands there, like \"Navigate back\", and you'll see options filter to a short list, along with hotkey shortcuts if they have them. At base, Obsidian is a tool for working with a bunch of markdown files that are stored on your computer. If you're not familiar with markdown, it's just plain text with some formatting that makes it powerful (for more on that, see [[Format your notes|Markdown]]) . As a result, if you want to use obsidian for keeping regular notes on just about anything, it will work great. Let's say you want to write a note about your favorite band. Just type the name of the note surrounded by two square brackets, like [[My Favorite Band]] Try it here (make sure you're typing in the Editor pane): You'll notice that the text and the brackets turn blue. That means it's a link now. Click on that link in the Preview (or Cmd-click in the Editor), and you'll see a blank note. Write whatever you want there, and when you're done, come back here with Cmd-alt-left , or by clicking the name of this note ([[Basic note taking]]) in the Backlinks to the right. To learn more about navigating links, see [[Internal link]]. Notice that your new note showed up automatically in the File Explorer to the left. Obsidian automatically creates files when you click a link to a file that does not exist. This means you can [[write naturally]] about [[whatever comes to mind]] and then go back and create the new notes at your leisure. This makes Obsidian a fantastic tool for thinking freely in notes without having to worry about where to file them. And if you decide that a title is not what you actually meant, you can change the file name at the top of this window, and Obsidian will automatically update all links to it. From there, you can make any kind of structure you want. Many people will want to make a Table of Contents note for listing major groups of notes. You can also use #tags to create categories (if you click that it will show you every note that contains #tags ). Really, the structure you build should be whatever works for you. We suggest you just start with what feels natural. Obsidian is flexible enough that it should be relatively simple to rearrange things later. Be aware! The note you just created is in these Help documents, which will be overwritten on new releases. ==If you created anything you care to keep, it should be put into a different vault==.

For example, you can't embed a YouTube video by using its normal URL, but you can use its embed URL which is https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID . If you want to embed a website, try searching for \"{website} embed iframe\". For example, you can embed Twitter tweets like so as suggested by search results: <iframe border=0 frameborder=0 height=250 width=550 src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjack%2Fstatus%2F20\"> </iframe> Developer notes The syntax is inspired by Markdown's image syntax.

The internal link syntax is based on this assumption: [[My page]] is a shortcut (or \"syntactic sugar\" if you will) for [My page](My page) .

Under Linked mentions you can see that I made a link to this document in the [[Linked pane]] note. But, you can also see under Unlinked mentions that I wrote the name of this note but did not make it a link. This can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you were making when you wrote them. If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in your field, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships between ideas you might not have otherwise. If a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a Link button. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, making it into an explicit link. You can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under the More Options menu.

You can open another Vault anywhere on your computer, and it will retain its own individual [[Core plugins|Plugins]] and [[Add custom styles|custom styling]]. This is useful, for example, if you have one Vault where you keep notes but a different one in which you do long-form writing. A new or existing Vault can be opened from the button just above the Settings gear. ![[Vault picker.png]] You have the option to either open an existing folder of markdown files, create a new vault (which essentially just creates a new folder that you will put markdown files into), or opening a special vault containing these help files. The Help Vault is stored in a special Obsidian directory (see [[How Obsidian stores data]]), but aside from that, it's a directory of files just like any other. [[Internal link|Internal Links]] are not shared across Vaults. If you have one Vault inside another Vault, this can get confusing, so we recommend not doing that. Always remember, a Vault is just a collection of markdown files. You can use whatever file management techniques you would normally to move them around on your file system, and Obsidian will automatically refresh to keep up.

Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notes in or a type of idea. Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as \"entry points\" for thinking about connected ideas. But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like. Tag pane If you have the [[Tag pane]] plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes, sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search. This will allow you to search exact matches of a tag.

For instructions on how to publish your notes from within the Obsidian app, refer to the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. Privacy You have total control over what to publish via the [[Publish|Publish plugin]] - either your entire vault or just selected notes within your vault. As for any notes you choose not to publish, you can be confident that those notes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them. Backing up Please note that Obsidian Publish is not to be used as a backup for your content. Make sure you always have a personal backup copy of your site using your preferred backup method. Our efforts on Obsidian Publish will be more focused on functionality, ease of use, and site availability. Demo There's a good chance that you're already viewing this article on our official site powered by Obsidian Publish. If not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help. What's included The Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing the notes you want to publish. To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length. There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. Changes to these options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes. Navigation Enabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them. Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate. Search bar Adds a search bar to page. This bar can be used to search for pages, aliases, and headings within pages. It does not currently search through the full text content of the site. Graph view Displays a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [[Graph view]] plugin in Obsidian. Table of contents Displays a table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page, similar to the [[Outline]] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted as they scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it. Backlinks Displays a section at the end of each page called \"Linked to this page\", containing backlinks from other pages. If there are no backlinks, the section will not be displayed. Tags When the reader clicks on a tag, they can see a list of other pages that includes the same tag. Hover preview When hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [[Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian. Custom CSS To customize the styling of your site, you can upload a publish.css . This file must be stored in the root folder of your site. You can use your existing theme and add some extra tweaks for publish in publish.css . Favicon To change the favicon of your site, you can upload png icons of any size in the format of favicon-32.png or favicon-32x32.png . You can also upload the file favicon.ico . These files can be stored in any folder. The current recommendation (as of 2020) is to provide sizes 32\u00d732 , 128x128 , 152\u00d7152 , 167x167 , 180x180 , 192x192 , and 196x196 . Custom JS If you wish to execute your own JavaScript code to change the visitor experience, or add various integrations like Discus!, Discourse, etc. you can do so by uploading publish.js inside the root of your vault. Note that these scripts will only run for visitors to your custom domain. Disallow search engine indexing This option adds a meta noindex tag to all your pages so search engines like Google does not index your site. Note that search engines won't be able to index your site anyway if it's password protected. Google Analytics If you wish to setup Google Analytics for your site, first make sure your local laws and regulations allows. Then, you just need to put the tracking code, in the form of UA-XXXXX-Y into the text box and your site will automatically track page views. Note that Google Analytics is only available to visitors from your custom domain. When testing Google Analytics, please make sure to disable any ad-blocking browser extensions like uBlock Origin which blocks Google Analytics scripts from running. Also, Obsidian Publish isn't directly compatible with Google Tag Manager at the moment - you can set it up using custom javascript if you wish to use Google Tag Manager instead of Google Analytics. Custom domain You can setup a custom domain or subdomain for your Obsidian Publish site. Currently, we don't yet have a way to provision SSL certificate on your behalf, so you need to resort to either an SSL-enabled server of your own, or to setup your site on CloudFlare, which provides SSL for free. You can also setup Obsidian Publish as a sub-URL of a site you own. For example, https://mysite.com/my-notes/ . To achieve this, you must host your own server and proxy all requests to our server at https://publish.obsidian.md/ . Continue reading for setup details. CloudFlare setup The easiest way to setup a custom domain or subdomain is by making an account with CloudFlare and letting CloudFlare manage your domain. This allows you to add SSL to your site for free, as well as ensure your site is fast wherever in the world it's accessed from. Typically users will host their Obsidian Publish content on a root domain (e.g. mysite.com ) or an immediate subdomain (e.g. notes.mysite.com ). These instructions work for both cases. Open Cloudflare to the domain you wish to add Publish to (e.g. mysite.com , even if you want a subdomain like notes.mysite.com ). Go to DNS and click Add Record. Select CNAME, and in 'name' enter the domain or subdomain you wish (e.g. notes.mysite.com ). In 'target', enter the value publish-main.obsidian.md . Do not include your personal sub-URL in this value, as Obsidian Publish handles this from your configuration. Go to SSL/TLS and set the SSL/TLS encryption mode to Full . This will configure the SSL/TLS certificate automatically. Once you are done with configuring CloudFlare, you can head to your site options in Obsidian, and set the URL to your domain or subdomain. This allows our server to associate the domain to your site. Troubleshooting: If your custom domain setup ends up in a redirect loop, it's likely that the encryption mode in CloudFlare to Flexible instead of Full . If you wish to configure both mysite.com and www.mysite.com to Obsidian Publish, you will need to create a Page Rule as follows: - URL match: www.mysite.com/* - Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect - Redirect URL: https://mysite.com/$1 Once you create the page rule, you should also create a CNAME record for www.mysite.com just like you created for mysite.com Proxy/redirect setup If you wish to host your own web server and setup your own SSL encryption, you can choose this option. If you are already hosting a website under your domain or subdomain, you can also use this option and setup your website to load your Obsidian Publish site under a specific URL path, instead of hosting the full site. Simply proxy all requests under that URL path to https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/... and configure the site options in Obsidian to the same URL path by setting Custom URL to mysite.com/my-notes . NGINX location /my-notes { proxy_pass https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/; proxy_ssl_server_name on; } Apache Add to .htaccess : RewriteEngine on RewriteRule \"^my-notes/(.*)$\" \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/$1\" [L,P] Note: mod_rewrite must be enabled, and you may also need to configure SSLProxyEngine Netlify [[redirects]] from = \"https://mysite.com/my-notes/*\" to = \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:splat\" status = 200 force = true Vercel In vercel.json configure rewrites : { ... \"rewrites\": [ { \"source\": \"/my-notes/\", \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes\" }, { \"source\": \"/my-notes/:path*\", \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:path*\" } ] } Supported HTTP X-Headers Alternatively, if your proxy service does not allow query paths, you can use https://publish.obsidian.md/ with a custom header x-obsidian-custom-domain set to your site url mysite.com/my-subpath . Custom domain post-setup issues Once you setup your custom domain, if you've visited your site from your previous https://publish.obsidian.md/slug link, you may have to clear your browser cache for certain things (like fonts, graphs, or password access) to work properly. This is due to the cross-domain security restrictions that are imposed by modern browsers. The good news is that readers of your site should never run into issue this if you only let visitors use your custom domain. Redirect old site to custom domain If you'd like to redirect your visitors from the old publish.obsidian.md site to your new custom domain, there is an option you can enable in the custom domain settings page which will do just that. Coming up Obsidian Publish is still in its early days. Here are some features we plan to add: Full custom domain support (with SSL certificate provisioning). Full text search. More built-in themes. Please let us know if you have any Obsidian Publish feature requests by submitting a forum request here . Pricing For the pricing of Obsidian Publish, please visit our pricing page . Technical details Obsidian Publish uses Cloudflare as the CDN (content delivery network) to distribute your site across the globe for a faster access. This involves caching copies of the files of your site on some of the 200+ data centers to ensure the lowest latency for your readers and the site remain speedy and loads fast even if your viewer lives far away from our primary servers. However, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitors might not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour before it has to be \"re-validated\" to ensure the content hasn't changed. If you've just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a \"hard refresh\" by holding the reload button and choosing \"Hard reload\" in the dropdown menu. Failing that, you can try clearing the browser cache or disabling cache using the developer tools in the network tab. Hosting media files While Obsidian Publish allows you to upload video clips, it is not optimized for video delivery. As such, your visitors may find that the videos on your site may not deliver a great experience. We recommend using a proper video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos for Obsidian Publish. The advantages of using a proper video hosting site includes: - Automatic re-encoding ensures that your videos can be played on all mobile devices regardless of what encoding format you used in your original file. - Dynamic quality adjustment based on bandwidth availability and ensures that videos can be played smoothly without constantly pausing for \"buffering\". - High efficiency video compression to ensure that visitors don't blow through their data cap when viewing your site. - Global CDN allowing your videos to be loaded fast regardless of where your visitor is located in the world.

However, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitors might not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour before it has to be \"re-validated\" to ensure the content hasn't changed. If you've just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a \"hard refresh\" by holding the reload button and choosing \"Hard reload\" in the dropdown menu.

How Obsidian Sync works Obsidian Sync is fairly simple: once you hook up local vaults from multiple devices to the same remote vault, changes will be automatically synced between these local vaults, except for files and folders you instruct Obsidian to ignore. Features Currently, Obsidian Sync features: End-to-end encryption. Version history integrated into Obsidian. View & restore deleted files. Synchronize settings, themes, CSS snippets, plugins, and plugin settings. Selective sync. Exclude certain folders. Toggle syncing for images, audio, video, PDF, and unsupported files. Switch between multiple remote vaults. In the future, we'll improve Obsidian Sync with: Vault sharing Enable Obsidian Sync plugin You can enable Obsidian Sync by enabling the \"Sync\" plugin under Settings => Core plugins. Setting up remote vaults Warning: We do not recommend using third party sync services to sync the same vault with Obsidian Sync. [[#Third party sync|More about this later]]. To start syncing, first you need to create a remote vault that stores your encrypted data. To do that, go to Setting => Sync => Pick remote vault => Choose => Create new vault. After creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the \"Connect\" button next to it. You can choose to either start syncing immediately after connecting, or choose folders to ignore. Set encryption password By default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt your data and is extremely important. You'll be asked for the password any time you setup sync with an encrypted vault. ==If you forget or lose the password, your data will remain encrypted and unusable forever. We are unable to recover your password or any encrypted data for you.== Your local files are not affected. You can also choose to turn off the \"Custom end-to-end password\" option to leave managing the encryption key to us. This is still fairly secure and provides the convenience of not having to remember a password. Check sync status After connecting to a remote vault, you can check the current sync status in the bottom status bar. You can hover over the status icon to read more about what's going on. Clicking on the status icon will open up sync settings as a shortcut. Version history As you edit your notes, versions are saved approximately every 10 seconds. ==Version history is only available for notes, not attachments.== You can right click a file in the file explorer pane to see its version history. This option is also available in the more options menu. After selecting a version in the left column in the version history screen, you can restore the file to this version by clicking on the \"Restore\" button. Deleted files After you delete a file, you can view it in Setting => Sync => Deleted files => View. Clicking on a deleted file will open its version history. You can then choose to restore the file back to a previous version. Selective sync You can selectively sync files by folder or file type. ==Selective sync only applies to future changes. Any files that have already been uploaded will not be deleted even if you choose to ignore them. Please be sure to configure it before starting the sync process.== Exclude folders You can uncheck folders in Settings => Sync => Excluded folders => Manage to prevent them from getting synced. Excluded folders will be ignored when both uploading and download changes. File types You can toggle sync for images, audio, video, PDFs, and unsupported files under Settings => Sync => Selective sync. Synchronizing settings In addition to your notes and attachments, Obsidian Sync offers individual toggles to synchronize these files: - The main app settings, including editor settings, files & links settings, etc. - Appearance settings, including dark mode, selected theme, and enabled snippets. - Themes and snippets that has been downloaded. - Hotkeys. - Which [[Core plugins]] are enabled. - Core plugin settings. - Which community plugins are enabled. - Downloaded/installed community plugins, and their settings. You can choose which ones to synchronize with your remote vault to best suite your use case of Obsidian. Keep in mind that Obsidian does not apply your settings until you restart the application, or reload the vault. This normally isn't a problem on mobile since the app restarts often, but you may notice that settings you set on one desktop device is \"synced\" to another device, but doesn't take effect until the next restart. Sync will respect your selection of the settings folder override in case you've set it to a folder other than .obsidian . You can take advantage of this to create different profiles in your remote vault to sync your settings. A common use case, for example, is to use a different profile for mobile devices vs desktop devices. Settings version history If something goes wrong, and you lost some of your settings, you can always revert the affected settings file through the \"Settings version history\" section in Sync. Third party sync If you are using Obsidian Sync, we do not recommend using third party sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud to sync the same vault between the same devices using Obsidian Sync. Doing so may cause conflicts, duplicate files, or in the worst case, could lead to corrupted files. If you do setup Obsidian Sync and a third party sync service to sync a vault between two devices, then the following will happen: - If Obsidian Sync \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then your third party sync service will generate a \"conflicted copy\". - If your third party sync service \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then Obsidian Sync will attempt to merge the two slightly different versions, often causing the last few characters you just typed to be rolled back. If you wish to maintain a backup of your vault using a third party sync service, you can still do so by setting up your sync provider on your primary single device, but not on your secondary devices. This will ensure that your third party sync service does not \"race\" with Obsidian Sync. FAQ What is end-to-end encryption? End-to-end encryption means the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only be decrypted using your encryption key once it's back on one of your devices. We do not have the capability of reading your data, nor do any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internet service provider. In the rare case of a complete server breach, your data will remain encrypted, and nobody will have the ability to decrypt your files without knowing your password. How many remote vaults can I have? Each account with Obsidian Sync can have up to 5 remote vaults. How long is version history kept? Version histories are kept for up to one year before we clean it up. How large can each remote vault be? At the moment, each remote vault can have up to 4 GB of data, including version history. Is my data encrypted on my hard disk? No, your data is still in plain text on your hard disk. If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer, you should look for a disk encryption solution. How long is my data kept after my subscription expires? Data in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscription expires. As long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage. Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution? Obsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service. With version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additional backup measures. Obsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugs and glitches. Should I pick my own encryption password? Pick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy. This guarantees that anyone who doesn't know your password will never be able to read your notes. Letting us manage your encryption key is more convenient, and you do not risk forgetting or losing your password. Your local vault is not affected by this option. If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problem for you. Is the end-to-end encryption strong? We use industry-standard AES-256 to encrypt your data. AES-256 is a military-grade encryption specification that is widely used in online banking. Here are the technical details for those interested: Key derivation function used: scrypt with salt Encryption algorithm used: AES-256 using GCM What does the vault limit exceeded error mean? Each vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb. This error indicates your vault has exceeded that limit in size. Don't forget: attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your 4gb limit even if your vault's actual size is less than 4gb. If you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault. Go to the Obsidian Sync settings in Preferences => Sync and look for the \"Vault size over limit\" options.","title":"Obsidian Sync"},{"location":"Licenses%20%26%20add-on%20services/Obsidian%20Sync/#how-obsidian-sync-works","text":"Obsidian Sync is fairly simple: once you hook up local vaults from multiple devices to the same remote vault, changes will be automatically synced between these local vaults, except for files and folders you instruct Obsidian to ignore.","title":"How Obsidian Sync works"},{"location":"Licenses%20%26%20add-on%20services/Obsidian%20Sync/#features","text":"Currently, Obsidian Sync features: End-to-end encryption.

On Android, the Obsidian home folder is stored in the public documents folder under Documents/Obsidian . The public Documents folder is typically stored in SD card or emulated storage. Any folder in this home folder will be considered a vault. If you sync or copy a vault folder into this directory, it can be recognized when you open Obsidian. Sync On Android, you may choose to use [[Obsidian Sync]] to synchronize your files, or use any third party sync provider that can perform sync in the background. Obsidian Sync As with Obsidian desktop, we provide our built-in paid [[Obsidian Sync]] service. To setup a synced vault through Obsidian Sync, first create a new empty local vault. You should name it the same as your desktop app to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work. Once the empty vault is open, open the left sidebar, tap the settings button, and setup Obsidian Sync just like you did on Desktop: Login to your Obsidian account in the Account tab. Enable the Sync core plugin. Open settings, and choose the \"Sync\" tab under \"Plugin options\". Choose the remote vault to sync with. Keep the app open until all your files have synced over. To view the sync status of Obsidian Sync, swipe to pull out the right drawer, and you should see the status indicator just like it shows on the desktop app. Tap on it to get more information, such as viewing the sync log to debug any issues. Third party sync You can also use your preferred sync solution to keep the local folder on your phone in sync with other devices. There are apps on the Play Store that let you sync a folder on your phone with other devices, for example Dropsync or FolderSync . Storage Permission When starting Obsidian, you may notice that it prompts for permission to access your device's documents and media. In an ideal world, we'd prefer to only ask for access rights to the vault folders you choose. However, Android's privacy-friendly file permission API (also known as \"scoped storage\") has a few restrictions that makes it impossible for Obsidian to function properly. The two biggest roadblocks are: - Scoped storage performs many extra permission checks for every single file access, causing significant performance degradation when opening and using Obsidian. - Scoped storage does not provide a way to watch for external changes, which is critical when using Obsidian with a third-party synchronization tool. Google specifically gives instructions for developers of this kind of apps a special permission. Obsidian belongs to two categories in the list of exceptions: \"document management apps\", and \"on-device file search\".

In an ideal world, we'd prefer to only ask for access rights to the vault folders you choose. However, Android's privacy-friendly file permission API (also known as \"scoped storage\") has a few restrictions that makes it impossible for Obsidian to function properly. The two biggest roadblocks are: - Scoped storage performs many extra permission checks for every single file access, causing significant performance degradation when opening and using Obsidian. - Scoped storage does not provide a way to watch for external changes, which is critical when using Obsidian with a third-party synchronization tool. Google specifically gives instructions for developers of this kind of apps a special permission. Obsidian belongs to two categories in the list of exceptions: \"document management apps\", and \"on-device file search\".

If you choose, you can store your vaults in iCloud Drive. These vaults can be found in your iCloud Drive folder, under an app folder named \"Obsidian\" that shows the Obsidian logo. If you choose not to use iCloud for a vault, then it will be stored in the sandboxed file system of the Obsidian app. The local vaults are accessible from any other apps that support picking a folder from the file system. As such, apps like Working Copy can be used to sync with Obsidian's local vaults. ==Be aware that if you choose to store your vault locally, they will be automatically deleted by iOS when you uninstall Obsidian's app.== Sync Quick start If you already have a vault on your desktop, here's the two ways to sync your vault to mobile and access it: [[#iCloud Drive Sync]] [[#Obsidian Sync]] The two current officially supported sync solutions are iCloud and Obsidian Sync. Working Copy (git) is another alternative that has been tested to work with Obsidian on iOS. Currently, there is no known support for the following sync services on iOS yet: - Dropbox - Google Drive - OneDrive - Syncthing If you find out a way to sync using these services on iOS with Obsidian, we would be glad if you can join our Discord server and teach us how to set it up. In theory, any third party sync providers that can provide background-sync for a specific folder on your device should be able to work, but we are not aware of any other than Working Copy. This is due to the limitations of the highly complex mechanism of cross-app file sharing in iOS, unlike Android which allows easy cross-app file sharing. Because of this, most third party sync providers don't have a proper implementation for background sync on iOS. Currently Obsidian does not support third party sync providers that expose a virtual file system through FileProvider. We will be attempting this in the future as an improvement. Obsidian Sync You can follow the same steps as Android's sync as shown below, making sure that you create a non-iCloud folder as we do not recommend using both Obsidian Sync and iCloud Sync concurrently, which has been reported to cause data loss due to [[Obsidian Sync#Third party sync|race conditions]]. ![[Android app#Obsidian Sync]] iCloud Drive Sync To setup a new synced vault through iCloud Drive: Start the iOS app and choose \"Create a new vault\"; On desktop, using the \"Open another vault\" option, point to the new vault location in iCloud. To setup an existing vault to be synced through iCloud Drive: Start the app and choose \"Create a new vault\"; Name it the same as your desktop vault to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work; Wait for iCloud to sync this empty folder to your desktop; Copy and paste everything under your vault to this empty folder, this will now be your synced folder location; On desktop, using the \"Open another vault\" option, point to the new vault location in iCloud; Wait for iCloud to sync everything to your mobile device. Working Copy You can alternatively setup Working Copy to use Git to sync your vault on iOS. To do this, you should create an empty local vault on your device first, then you can \"Setup Folder Sync\" and select a local vault inside the Obsidian app. Then, you can manually commit & push. Third party sync support Many users asks why Obsidian for Mobile doesn't support their preferred sync solution. Here's a brief explanation on the current state of mobile sync support. The thing about Obsidian that's different from other apps like 1Writer and iA Writer is that Obsidian works on top of a vault rather than a single note. Many of the core Obsidian functionality depend on the whole vault and all the files inside, such as the link auto-complete, image embedding, tag pane, backlinks, and all the cross-note functionality. In contrast, most Markdown editing apps simply \"open\" a single note, let the user perform edits, then save the note back. Because of this, the OS and third party sync providers typically only provide an API for accessing/working with a single file, but not so much for working with a vault (folder of files with potentially subfolders). For sync, a regular markdown editor app can simply implement the basic \"download file when you open a selected file\" and \"upload the file back when you press save\". Obsidian has to download the whole vault to be useful, and keep track of all the modified files (like for example, when you perform a file rename, we might update a bunch of other files for links that has changed due to the rename). On top of that, we need a way to monitor for changes through the sync solution to be able to update our internal caches when files change, to provide accurate links. Keeping all that in sync with a third party sync provider would be quite tedious - and this is actually part of the reason why most sync providers don't make a proper sync client for mobile and you have to use a third party app (like DropSync or FolderSync) to do it. Unfortunately, such apps don't exist on iOS because of app sandboxing. Known issues iCloud folder on macOS If you find yourself unable to drag & drop things into the iCloud folder in Finder on macOS, please download the latest Obsidian Desktop release from https://obsidian.md as it contains a fix for this issue. Once it's installed, running the app should automatically cause iCloud to update the folder permissions. If this does not work right away, you may need to restart your machine. Paste menu sometimes not appearing Some users runs into an issue where tapping on the cursor does not show the paste menu. As a workaround, you can use the three-finger tap gesture to trigger a global edit menu which can be used to paste into the text.","title":"iOS app"},{"location":"Obsidian/iOS%20app/#where-are-my-vaults-stored","text":"If you choose, you can store your vaults in iCloud Drive.

Currently, there is no known support for the following sync services on iOS yet: - Dropbox - Google Drive - OneDrive - Syncthing If you find out a way to sync using these services on iOS with Obsidian, we would be glad if you can join our Discord server and teach us how to set it up. In theory, any third party sync providers that can provide background-sync for a specific folder on your device should be able to work, but we are not aware of any other than Working Copy. This is due to the limitations of the highly complex mechanism of cross-app file sharing in iOS, unlike Android which allows easy cross-app file sharing. Because of this, most third party sync providers don't have a proper implementation for background sync on iOS. Currently Obsidian does not support third party sync providers that expose a virtual file system through FileProvider.

Here's a brief explanation on the current state of mobile sync support. The thing about Obsidian that's different from other apps like 1Writer and iA Writer is that Obsidian works on top of a vault rather than a single note. Many of the core Obsidian functionality depend on the whole vault and all the files inside, such as the link auto-complete, image embedding, tag pane, backlinks, and all the cross-note functionality. In contrast, most Markdown editing apps simply \"open\" a single note, let the user perform edits, then save the note back. Because of this, the OS and third party sync providers typically only provide an API for accessing/working with a single file, but not so much for working with a vault (folder of files with potentially subfolders). For sync, a regular markdown editor app can simply implement the basic \"download file when you open a selected file\" and \"upload the file back when you press save\". Obsidian has to download the whole vault to be useful, and keep track of all the modified files (like for example, when you perform a file rename, we might update a bunch of other files for links that has changed due to the rename). On top of that, we need a way to monitor for changes through the sync solution to be able to update our internal caches when files change, to provide accurate links. Keeping all that in sync with a third party sync provider would be quite tedious - and this is actually part of the reason why most sync providers don't make a proper sync client for mobile and you have to use a third party app (like DropSync or FolderSync) to do it. Unfortunately, such apps don't exist on iOS because of app sandboxing.","title":"Third party sync support"},{"location":"Obsidian/iOS%20app/#known-issues","text":"","title":"Known issues"},{"location":"Obsidian/iOS%20app/#icloud-folder-on-macos","text":"If you find yourself unable to drag & drop things into the iCloud folder in Finder on macOS, please download the latest Obsidian Desktop release from https://obsidian.md as it contains a fix for this issue.

If you do not use YAML to flag publish files, the default behaviour is to automatically select changed files, but not new files. Make changes As you make changes to notes that have already been published, those changes will be automatically selected when you open the Publish plugin dialog. You may uncheck any files you wish not to publish to your site. Change site options You can change various site options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name when in the \"Publish changes\" dialogue. Metadata In this section, you can set site name, home page file (the file visitors see when they land on your site), and manage custom domain (please see [[Obsidian Publish#Custom domain|this guide]] to set up your custom domain). Appearance Here you can change the theme between light and dark. If you want more customization, you can look into setting up [[Obsidian Publish#Custom CSS|custom CSS]] and [[Obsidian Publish#Favicon|favicon]]. Reading experience In this section, you can: Enable a special mode called \"sliding windows\" that looks like Andy Matuschak's notes ; Enable page preview on hover like when using [[Page preview]] plugin in the app; Configure whether you want readable line length and strict line breaks. Components Your site comes with a few components that you can toggle on or off. These include: File explorer (default on) Local graph (default on) Outline (default off) Backlink at the bottom (default off) Search bar (default off, requires file explorer) Security Here you can set passwords to protect your site. Once set, all visitors need to enter one of the passwords to enter your site. Multiple passwords facilitate sharing with multiple groups. When you no longer wish to share with one group of visitors, you can simply delete that password. Each password can be named for your convenience as well. As of 2021/01/20, all notes on your site are protected by the same set of passwords. Add linked notes The \"Add linked\" button allows you to include for publishing any notes in your vault that are referenced (linked to) by any currently selected notes. This is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site. By way of example, let's assume you select Note A for publishing. Supposing Note A has links to Note P, Note Q, and Note R, then if you click the \"Add linked\" button, Notes P, Q, and R will all be selected for publishing along with the currently selected Note A. Each time you click the \"Add linked\" button, the Publish plugin will look for links within every currently selected file to include for publication. Please be sure you review the list of selected files before clicking the \"Publish\" button. Delete published notes You always have the option of removing any notes that have been published to your site. Within the Publish plugin, all published notes will be listed, of which any/all can be selected for removal. Deleting a note from your site does not remove the note from your vault, thus giving you the option to re-publish the note again in the future. Delete entire site If you'd like to delete an entire site, click the switch-site (arrows) icon near the top of the Publish plugin. Then click the X button to delete your site.

In most cases, if you just type what you want to find, it will work. But search has many capabilities for narrowing down to find exactly what you want. Quick tips Start searching You can invoke search by pressing Ctrl-Shift-F or Cmd-Shift-F . You can also customize this hotkey in Settings => Hotkeys. When search is invoked, focus will be automatically put in the search bar so you can start typing your query right away. Search selected text After you select text, you can search for it by simply invoking search like above. Search history Obsidian will remember your most recently used search queries. These queries will be presented to you when your search query is empty. You can click on any one of them to search for it again, allowing you to easily re-run previous queries. To clear search history, simply click on the \"X\" button. Search Settings There are a couple of toggles available while searching: Match case toggle case sensitive matching, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basis using the match-case: and ignore-case: operators explained above. Explain search term will show you what the search query actually does in plain terms. Collapse results will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines in which matches appear. These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the folding triangle next to the file name. Show more context will expand the display of the matches to show more text around the match. Change sort order sorts the results by various orders, similar to how files are sorted in the [[File explorer]]. Copy search results To quickly and easily take your search results to a list, use the \"copy search result\" option. You can customize whether you want to show paths, which link style to use (wikilink or Markdown link), and how you want your list to appear. Embed search results You can embed search results in a note. For example, if you write: ```query embed OR search ``` You should see this embedded search view (note: it doesn't work on [[Obsidian Publish]] as of 2020/01/18): embed OR search Search syntax Combining sub-queries When crafting a search query, remember that clicking \"Explain Search Term\" will give an explanation of what is being searched for, which can be very useful when debugging a complicated search. Words in the search query separated by space will be searched independently in each note. For example foo bar will find a note that includes both foo and bar anywhere in it. \"Quoted strings\" can be used to search multiple consecutive words separated by space, or in other words, a phrase. So, searching for \"foo bar\" with quotes will only find notes that include those words next to each other. You can use backslash \\\" to escape double quotes if you actually want to search for a string that includes quotes. And \\\\ will do the same for backslash. Boolean operations can be used. Use OR to match one or another. Use - to negate a query. The space character is used for boolean \"and\". For example: foo OR bar will find all notes that contain either of those words, they don't have to be in the same note. foo -bar will find all notes that contain foo , but not if they also contain bar . Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example ((a OR b) (c OR d)) . This can be useful when crafting complex searches to make sure things happen in the order you want. Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression. For example: /[a-z]{3}/ . Obsidian accepts the JavaScript flavor regular expressions. You can learn more about it here . Search operators Several special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: file:(\"to be\" OR -\"2B\") . You can use - to exclude specific results from search, for example: foo -tag:#bar . file:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file name. For example: file:.jpg . If you use Zettelkasten-style UIDs, this can be useful for narrowing a time range, for example file:202007 for files created in July of 2020. path:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root. For example: path:\"Daily Notes/2020-07\" . content:(...) will perform the following subquery on the file content. For example: content:\"happy cat\" . match-case:(...) and ignore-case(...): will override the case sensitive match logic for the following subquery. tag: will search for your specified tag within a file, for example tag:#work . This is faster and more accurate than searching for the tag in plaintext #work , as it uses the cached information and ignores text in code blocks and sections that aren't markdown text. line:(...) will perform the subquery on a line-by-line basis, rather than a file-by-file basis. For example, if you search for foo bar , this could match a file that has foo in the first paragraph and bar in the last paragraph. Searching for line:(foo bar) will only match if foo and bar are on the same line. block:(...) will perform the subquery on a block-by-block basis, where each block defined as a markdown block, typically separated by empty lines or list items. This is expensive computationally as it requires parsing each file, which means this is likely slower than other modes. section:(...) will perform the subquery on a section-by-section basis, where each section is the text between two headings, including the first heading. task:(...) will perform the subquery only on each [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use task:\"\" to match all tasks. task-todo:(...) will perform the subquery only on each uncompleted [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use task-todo:\"\" to match all uncompleted tasks. task-done:(...) will perform the subquery only on each completed [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis.

This has two main effects: By default, when opening a new [[Preview and edit modes|preview pane]] from an editing pane, the new pane is linked to the old one. This means that any changes you make in the editor will show up in the preview in real time. It also means that scrolling one will scroll the other. When a new [[Working with backlinks|Backlink Pane]] is created from a note, it will be linked to that note. This means that [[backlinks]] will always be shown for the note that is in that pane. This is useful if you want to reference a set of [[backlinks]] but let the regular backlink panel change with whatever other note you are working on. Linked panes will be marked with a link icon. You can hover the link to see which pane it's linked to, or click the icon to release it, so that they are no longer linked. This will not close the previously-linked pane.","title":"Linked pane"},{"location":"User%20interface/Workspace/Panes/Pane%20layout/","text":"One of the things that makes [[Obsidian]] different from other note-taking apps is how easy it is to open multiple files in your preferred configuration. The window a file gets opened in is what we call a \"pane\". You can have as many panes as you like. Open new panes Open links In general, you can click a link to a file while holding Ctrl (on Windows and Linux) or Cmd (on macOS) to open it in a new pane. This includes clicking on files in [[File explorer]], [[Search]] results, [[Backlinks]], [[Graph view]], etc. The only notable exception is in the editor. Because in the editor, a single click edits the link text rather than following it, Ctrl/Cmd-Click is used to follow the link. Therefore, you'll need to hold Shift in addition to Ctrl/Cmd in order to open the link in a new pane. Split current pane You can also use the \"More options\" menu option of a pane to select \"Split vertically\" or \"Split horizontally\" to open two copies of that file. Open linked views Some options in the \"More options\" menu will also open a new pane that's linked to the current pane, such as \"Open backlinks\" and \"Open local graph\". Rearrange panes To move a pane, simply drag the pane icon in the top left corner of the pane. As you drag it around, a visual indicator will appear to show where the pane will be placed. Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existing pane creates a horizontal or vertical split, and dropping in the center swaps positions with the target pane. You can also drag panes into the two sidebars. Panes in the sidebar work a bit differently, for more please see the [[#Panes in the sidebar]] section below. Panes in the sidebar There are some differences with panes that live in the [[Sidebar|sidebars]]. Sidebar panes can share space with tabs When your drop a pane onto a sidebar pane, a new tab will be created under that sidebar section. Different panes in the same sidebar section can be accessed by clicking on its tab icon. Sidebar panes do not show titles This reduces clutter, but also means it's best to keep one or two important files like a scratch pad or the daily note for quick access, rather than having a dozen files open. To see the title of a file that's in the sidebar, hover over its tab icon. Sidebar can be easily collapsed If there are panes that you only need to look at from time to time, having them in the sidebar makes it really easy to toggle them with a hotkey or command. Toggle editor and preview in sidebar The hotkey to toggle between editor and preview only works in the main workspace. In the sidebar, you'll need to right click on the tab icon and select \"Preview\" or \"Edit\" to toggle between two modes.
